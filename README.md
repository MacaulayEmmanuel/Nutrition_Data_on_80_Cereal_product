This project contains SQL queries written to gain some insights into our diet and health by analyzing a dataset of 80 cereal types from seven manufacturers containing the data about the content in nutrient groups (like fat or proteins) and elements (like potassium). questions we answered:

- What is the average content of each nutrient and element per manufacturer?
- What is the number of calories per ounce for each product?
- What is the average rating per manufacturer? Is it somehow connected to average nutrient content?
- Which manufacturer possesses the best shelf location?
- What is the nutritional value of each cereal according to protein, fat, and carbohydrate data.
